				pid does not refer to a direct child of the calling process.
				pid is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return value from a successful call to fork.
				Note that children are not inherited: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to wait(C) by process A must fail. Similarly, orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent if their parent process exits before they do.
The process that calls wait has already called wait on pid. That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.
